## Overview
The set of programs is intended for the Best Buy's team that overviews the code challenges for the digital and technology interview. The code challenge that I have chosen is code challenge number one. Which is the following: **"Pick a language and write a function(s) to find the first, 7 digits, prime, palindromic number in the digits of Pi Code does NOT need to calculate the digits of pi, feel free to copy-paste a string into your repo, but must be able to programmatically find the answer."**

## Why the first challenge?
The reason why I choose to code this challenge over the other is that I love problem-solving, and I love math so I could not resist making this work. Although the second code challenge looked very interesting as it seems to measure object-orientation skills I couldnâ€™t say no to the first challenge. 
When I started to look over the challenge it seemed like it was going to be very hard especially when trying to figure out if a number is prime but to my surprise, this was easier than what it sounds.

## Challenging myself
The bread and butter to my language of choice is Java. I do understand that Best Buy uses many different technologies and since I was able to finish the code challenge quicker than what I anticipated I wrote the same program in other languages. **I understand that this was not part of the requirements but for practice and experience (and bonus points of course) in languages that I don't commonly use I assumed it was a great thing to do.**

## Understanding the code
The java program is very straight forward. I have a text file that I saved the first 200,000 digits of pi. I then set a string equal to all the digits saved in the pi file. Then, I iterate through the string to get blocks of seven digits. Furthermore, I created two methods called "isPrime" and "isPalindrome" that find the first seven-digit prime, palindromic number. Please refer to the notes inside the file for more information about the code. 

## Conclusion
There were a few things that I learned from this challenge. After making a few versions of this and testing performance I do understand that there are a million different approaches for this challenge. My top two picks were either A: Storing the entire digits of pi in a String and computing the answer(which is the one that I delivered)  or B: Using a data structure such as a Queue to use as a delimiter to the seven-digit requirement. I went with option "A" as it was slightly faster when it came to execution time (but this really varies).
